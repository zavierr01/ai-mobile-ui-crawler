## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Build order set to Error Model -> Remove Appium -> Step State & UI Sync -> ADB Context (follows dependency chain from research)
- [Roadmap]: Coarse granularity -- compressed 5 requirement categories into 4 phases by combining DURB+SYNC
- [02-remove-appium]: ADB/DroidRun is the single supported device interaction layer; no abstraction for swappable providers
- [02-remove-appium]: `appium-python-client` removed from dependencies; fresh installs will not include Appium

### Pending Todos
