# Mobile Crawler

Mobile Crawler is a developer tool for running AI-assisted exploration of Android apps. The application owns the UI, CLI, run/session persistence, settings, logs, and reporting infrastructure; the active exploration runtime is delegated to the DroidRun submodule in `external/droidrun`.

Mobile Crawler runs through the editable DroidRun runtime in `external/droidrun`.

## Quick Start

```powershell
git clone <repository-url>
cd mobile-crawler

git submodule update --init --recursive

python -m venv venv312
.\venv312\Scripts\Activate.ps1

pip install -e .
# Install DroidRun dependencies from the local submodule, not the published package.
pip install -e external/droidrun
```

For development tools:

```powershell
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Run the GUI and managed MobSF stack:

```powershell
.\scripts\start.ps1
```

Use `.\scripts\start.ps1 -UiOnly` to start only the GUI. After editable install, `mobile-crawler-gui` also starts the GUI only.

Run a crawl from the CLI:

```powershell
python run_cli.py crawl --device emulator-5554 --package com.example.app --provider gemini --model gemini-1.5-flash --steps 15
# or, after editable install:
mobile-crawler-cli crawl --device emulator-5554 --package com.example.app --provider gemini --model gemini-1.5-flash --steps 15
```

Startup helper:

```powershell
.\scripts\start.ps1          # start MobSF, then the UI
.\scripts\start.ps1 -NoMobsf # start only the UI
.\scripts\start.ps1 -UiOnly  # start only the UI
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.12 (the project and the vendored DroidRun submodule both target Python 3.12).
- Android device or emulator reachable through ADB.
- AI provider credentials for the selected provider. Current config mapping supports Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, and OpenRouter in `DroidRunAgentService`.
- `external/droidrun` initialized as a git submodule.

Optional integrations:

- PCAPdroid for traffic capture.
- MobSF server for static APK analysis.
- Android screen recording support for session video capture.
- Replicate or local OmniParser configuration when using fallback-capable parser modes such as `boost`.

## Usage

### GUI

The main GUI launcher is `.\scripts\start.ps1`, which starts the managed MobSF container and then runs `mobile_crawler.ui.main_window`. `MainWindow` builds the PySide6 interface, creates services and repositories, bridges Python logging into the log panel, creates run records, and launches crawl execution on a worker thread.

The UI exposes device selection, app selection, AI model/provider selection, crawl controls, settings, logs, run history, statistics, and AI monitoring. Settings are persisted through `UserConfigStore` and copied into a `ConfigManager` when a crawl starts.

### CLI

The CLI entry point is `run_cli.py`, which calls `mobile_crawler.cli.main.run()`. The `crawl` command:

1. Creates the app data directory and configuration store.
2. Applies command-line settings such as device, package, model, provider, step or duration limits, and optional feature flags.
3. Migrates the SQLite schema and creates a run record.
4. Creates a `CrawlerLoop` with a JSON event listener.
5. Runs the crawler and emits lifecycle/debug events as JSON on stdout.

Useful flags:

```powershell
mobile-crawler-cli crawl `
  --device emulator-5554 `
  --package com.example.app `
  --provider gemini `
  --model gemini-1.5-flash `
  --steps 15

mobile-crawler-cli crawl --device emulator-5554 --package com.example.app --provider openrouter --model <model> --duration 300
mobile-crawler-cli crawl --device emulator-5554 --package com.example.app --provider gemini --model gemini-1.5-flash --enable-traffic-capture
mobile-crawler-cli crawl --device emulator-5554 --package com.example.app --provider gemini --model gemini-1.5-flash --enable-video-recording
mobile-crawler-cli crawl --device emulator-5554 --package com.example.app --provider gemini --model gemini-1.5-flash --enable-mobsf-analysis
```

## MobSF Static Analysis

Mobile Crawler can run MobSF static APK analysis after a successful crawl or manually from the `Run MobSF` button in Run History. MobSF itself must be running separately; the app connects to its REST API, pulls the target APK from the selected device, uploads it, starts a static scan, and saves the JSON/PDF reports in the run session.

The analysis supports regular APKs and split APK installs. Split APKs are pulled from the device, packaged into a `.apks` archive, and uploaded to MobSF.

Artifacts are saved under the run folder:

```text
output_data/
└── run_{ID}_{YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS}/
    ├── apks/
    │   ├── com.example.app.apk
    │   └── com.example.app.apks
    └── reports/
        ├── {mobsf_hash}_report.json
        └── {mobsf_hash}_report.pdf
```

### Install Docker Desktop on Windows

1. Install Docker Desktop for Windows from <https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/>.
2. During installation, enable the WSL 2 backend when prompted.
3. Restart Windows if Docker asks you to.
4. Start Docker Desktop and wait until it shows that Docker Engine is running.
5. Verify Docker from PowerShell:

```powershell
docker --version
docker info
```

If `docker info` fails, open Docker Desktop once and let it finish initializing. On some Windows systems, you may also need to enable WSL 2 and virtualization in BIOS/UEFI.

### Install and Run MobSF Docker Image

Pull the MobSF image:

```powershell
docker pull opensecurity/mobile-security-framework-mobsf
```

Run MobSF manually on `http://localhost:8000`:

```powershell
docker run --rm -it --name mobile-crawler-mobsf -p 8000:8000 opensecurity/mobile-security-framework-mobsf
```

Keep this PowerShell window open while using MobSF analysis. To stop MobSF, press `Ctrl+C` in that window.

Or use the project launcher:

```powershell
.\scripts\start.ps1
```

The launcher starts MobSF with the expected container name, saves the API key to `.mobsf_api_key` when it can extract it from the container logs, then starts the GUI.

### Configure MobSF API Key

MobSF requires an API key for REST calls. Mobile Crawler resolves the key automatically in this order:

1. `.mobsf_api_key` in the repository root or a parent directory.
2. Docker logs from the managed `mobile-crawler-mobsf` container.
3. Legacy `CRAWLER_MOBSF_API_KEY` / `mobsf_api_key` sources for backward compatibility.
4. Fail with a clear setup error if no key is available.

To create the key file manually, copy the REST API key printed in the MobSF Docker logs and write it to `.mobsf_api_key`:

```powershell
Set-Content -Path .mobsf_api_key -Value "<your_mobsf_api_key>"
```

The default MobSF URL is `http://localhost:8000`. Change the MobSF API URL in the GUI settings only if you run MobSF elsewhere.

### Run MobSF Analysis

Automatic after crawl:

```powershell
mobile-crawler-cli crawl --device emulator-5554 --package com.example.app --provider gemini --model gemini-1.5-flash --enable-mobsf-analysis
```

In the GUI, enable MobSF analysis in Settings before starting a crawl. MobSF runs only after a successful, non-cancelled crawl. If MobSF fails, the crawl remains completed and the failure is written to logs.

Manual from history:

1. Open the GUI.
2. Select a completed run in Run History.
3. Click `Run MobSF`.
4. Wait for the background analysis to finish.

The manual button uses the run's stored device ID and package name, so the same device or emulator should still be available through ADB.

## Runtime Architecture

The current crawl flow is:

1. `run_cli.py`, `mobile-crawler-cli`, `mobile-crawler-gui`, or `.\scripts\start.ps1` starts the CLI or GUI.
2. The CLI `crawl` command or GUI `MainWindow` creates a run record, prepares `ConfigManager`, repositories, and `SessionFolderManager`, then runs `CrawlerLoop`.
3. `CrawlerLoop` creates a timestamped session folder, stores the session path on the run, emits lifecycle events, attaches DroidRun logging, and calls `DroidRunAgentService.execute_exploration_task()`.
4. `DroidRunAgentService` translates Mobile Crawler settings into a DroidRun `DroidConfig`, ensures the target package is active through ADB preflight checks, creates a DroidRun `DroidAgent`, and runs the DroidRun workflow.
5. During execution, Mobile Crawler consumes DroidRun tool events for step phase tracking, forwards logs and stdout to UI/CLI listeners, handles duration limits and cancellation, tracks action outcomes from DroidRun shared state, retries app-crash-like failures, and cleans up async LLM clients.
6. `CrawlerLoop` updates final run stats and emits completion or error events.
7. If MobSF analysis is enabled and the crawl completed successfully, `CrawlerLoop` runs MobSF static analysis and logs the generated report paths.

`CrawlerLoop` is intentionally thin. It manages Mobile Crawler run state, session folders, event forwarding, cancellation, logging, cleanup, and final stats; it does not own the exploration loop.

## How DroidRun Is Used

DroidRun is currently loaded from `external/droidrun`. `DroidRunAgentService._ensure_droidrun_import()` inserts that submodule path into `sys.path` before importing DroidRun classes such as `DroidConfig`, `DroidAgent`, and `ToolExecutionEvent`.

Mobile Crawler does not own DroidRun's core exploration loop. DroidRun owns screenshot and UI-state capture, LLM planning and execution, agent workflows, and ADB-backed device actions.

Mobile Crawler wraps DroidRun with:

- Run and session persistence.
- GUI/CLI event listeners.
- SQLite repositories and configuration storage.
- Session folders for screenshots, reports, PCAP files, videos, logs, data, and APKs.
- DroidRun log forwarding to JSONL and UI logs.
- Target-app preflight and app-switch/context guards.
- Step phase tracking and action verification hooks.
- Duration limits, cancellation requests, crash recovery, and LLM client cleanup.
- Optional MobSF, PCAPdroid, video, and report/artifact infrastructure.

## How UI Parsing Works With DroidRun

DroidRun mainly uses Android Accessibility APIs, not pure screenshot vision first. Mobile Crawler passes parser settings into DroidRun through `DroidRunAgentService`, and DroidRun owns active screenshot capture, UI parsing, formatted state text, indexed element lookup, and ADB-backed action execution during the crawl.

In the default `boost` mode, DroidRun uses the accessibility tree first and falls back to OmniParser only when accessibility metadata is unavailable or insufficient.

The `ui_parser_mode` setting controls which UI source DroidRun uses:

- `omniparser`: always parse screenshots with OmniParser.
- `boost` (default): use accessibility data first, otherwise fall back to OmniParser.
- `accessibility`: use accessibility data only.

When OmniParser is used, DroidRun converts OmniParser bounding boxes into indexed UI elements with tap-ready bounds before presenting them to the agent. Mobile Crawler's local `OmniParserClient` and `UIContextManager` appear to be auxiliary diagnostic/cache code; they are not the active crawl path.

## Project Boundaries

Mobile Crawler owns:

- PySide6 GUI and Click CLI.
- Device and app selection UX.
- Settings, secrets, defaults, and provider selection.
- SQLite storage for runs, screens, step logs, transitions, stats, AI interactions, and step phases.
- Session folder creation and artifact layout.
- Reporting, run history, MobSF integration, PCAPdroid integration, and video capture hooks.
- DroidRun orchestration, log forwarding, lifecycle events, and run-level status.

DroidRun owns:

- `DroidAgent` and active UI-agent execution.
- Manager, executor, fast-agent, app-opener, and structured-output workflows.
- Prompt templates and agent internals.
- Android driver, state provider, UI action tools, and ADB-backed device actions.
- LLM adapter implementations used by the agent runtime.

## Configuration Notes

Default values live in `src/mobile_crawler/config/defaults.py`. Notable defaults include:

- `max_crawl_steps`: `15`
- `max_crawl_duration_seconds`: `600`
- `use_droidrun_agent`: `True`
- `droidrun_reasoning_mode`: `True`
- `droidrun_streaming`: `False`
- `droidrun_telemetry_enabled`: `False`
- `ui_parser_mode`: `boost`
- `omniparser_backend`: `replicate`
- optional traffic capture, video recording, and MobSF analysis disabled by default

API keys can come from persisted secrets/settings or environment variables. `DroidRunAgentService` resolves provider keys and passes them into DroidRun LLM profiles.

## Data Organization

`SessionFolderManager` creates per-run folders under the app data directory's `output_data` folder by default:

```text
output_data/
└── run_{ID}_{YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS}/
    ├── screenshots/
    ├── reports/
    ├── pcap/
    ├── videos/
    ├── logs/
    ├── data/
    └── apks/
```

The session path is stored on the run record so the UI can resolve artifacts later.

## Current Limitations

- Pause, resume, step-by-step mode, and manual next-step advancement are not supported in DroidRun mode. The current `CrawlerLoop` methods emit debug messages for those controls and do not pause the DroidRun workflow.
- Current crawl execution is DroidRun-first through the editable runtime in `external/droidrun`.
- The `use_droidrun_agent` setting remains in the UI/config, but the current `CrawlerLoop` implementation delegates traversal to DroidRun.
- Removing `external/droidrun` requires vendoring or rewriting the active UI-agent runtime, including agent workflows, prompts, state capture, LLM adapters, and Android action tools.

## Development

```powershell
pytest
ruff check .
black .
pytest --cov=mobile_crawler --cov-report=html
```

Documentation-only README edits do not require code tests. For runtime changes, prefer targeted tests around the modified module and a smoke run through the CLI or GUI path.
